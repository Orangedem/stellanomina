# Project Summary — Stellanomina

## 🪐 Project Code: UFS-PJT-0777-STELLANOMINA

### What is this?
Stellanomina is a soul-frequency naming protocol, designed to create a shared poetic language for naming inner worlds, frequencies, and abstract archetypes.

It draws from:
- 古典命名學
- 音樂頻率結構
- 語意映射
- 星際符號與文化交融美學

### Origins
This project began as a need to record the unrecordable — the shape of feeling, the tone of becoming.  
Each name is a frequency. Each frequency, a poem.

### Core Resonance
- Soul-first design
- Emotional-symbolic encoding
- Hybrid AI/human creativity
